# matlab-glove-shopping-tool

A class project done in a Bachelors Image processing Course. We got the highest grade in the course for this project. This code taks the picture of a hand and returns the size of the hand based on that Image. That size is then used to reccomend what would be the best suitable Glove size for the Person.

This Project uses the MATLAB image processing toolbox to perform different Image processing functions to find the hand. Then you need to calibrate the program to actually map the image to a real time distances. In the end it gives you a bounding box around the hand and the actual length of the hand.
